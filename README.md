# P4 PDPI

P4Runtime generally uses a program-independent representation (or PI) for P4 entities
such as table entries, counters, etc. This is achieved by using IDs instead of
names. The downside of this is that the representation is hard to read by
humans. In contrast, a program-dependent (or PD) representation uses names and
is generally more friendly to humans.

This repository provides several PD-like representations, and code to automatically
convert between them.

This is a work in progress.
